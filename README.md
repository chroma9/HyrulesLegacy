**Hyrule's Legacy** is a game within Discord taking place in the land of Hyrule. This game is under
development at this time.

### Release Objectives
- ✅ Github Repository
- ❎ System Interfaces
- ❎ Database Configuration
- ❎ Unique Species
- ❎ Map Locations
- ❎ Environmental Elements

### Game Mechanics
Users will generate their characters based on information they provide. This includes things such
as Species, Home, and Various others. Players will also, as the game develops, be able to create
parties for travelling across the map and Discord. User accounts are consistent across servers.

The game will focus on combat, mild narative exploration and the use of a stat system. These features
were designed to resemble that of a **Dungeons & Dragons** like game with the system handling the wrath
of dice rolling itself.
